## Tips

### 1. Clear Chat Sessions

The output of the model is influenced by the contents of the chat session. To ensure that the output of the model is not influenced by previous prompts, click the "Clear Chat" button **before entering each new prompt**.

### 2. Copy-Paste Snippets

In a prompt-based exercise, you will find the prompt input is  provided to you in a _code-fenced_ snippet as shown below. When viewing this page in a browser, _click_ within the code-fenced region below to see a `copy` icon appear at the right. Click it to copy the prompt into your clipboard - then paste using <kbd>Ctrl-V</kbd> (or equivalent) command into the text input region in Playground.
